# switch 1 and 2 mapped to turning RAM/ROM replacement on or off
# switch 1 - RAM replacement on/off
# switch 2 - ROM replacement on/off
# switch 3 and 4 will select between:
# BASIC 1 (3 off, 4 off)
# BASIC 2 (3 on, 4 off)
# BASIC 3 (3 off, 4 on)
# BASIC 4 (3 on, 4 on)

# expanded, this is:
# SW: 1234
# 0   0000 - RAM off, ROM off, BASIC 1
# 1   1000 - RAM on, ROM off, BASIC 1
# 2   0100 - RAM off, ROM on, BASIC 1
# 3   1100 - RAM on, ROM on, BASIC 1
# 4   0010 - BASIC 2
# 5   1010 - 
# 6   0110 - 
# 7   1110 -
